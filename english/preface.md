>Hello everyone, this is the blog of Big Mogician.

I'm a lazy boy, and don' want to toss too many troublesome things, although I heard that github is going to be restricted by GFW, 
but Iâ€™m still prefer to write blogs with github.com in a simple way.

I will record some of the illustrations here, not only about coding, but also the daily trivia.

I will record my accumulation in all aspects. Maybe I won't write a lot of these, but I something will be here when I have ideas.

I won't only use Chinese here.
I still will try my best to describe my opinion in my poor English so that all the gayhuber from the world will understand.

Please remember to follew me if you are interested ðŸ˜„ !
