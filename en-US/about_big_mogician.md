> Big Mogician is me, 😅

### Basic
I'm [**@Big Mogician**](https://weibo.com/miao17game) , and you can call me BM(●—●).

Born in 1994, sign is Leo 🦁, normal orientation, male 🧔, and habit is beauty 💃 XD.

For gentleman : code is important, for beauties : code is cheaper than me.

### Habits
I'd like coding after work, staying in library at weekend. I'm a frontend engineer 👨‍💻, in Hangzhou.

Like animals, especially cats 🐈, and have a plan to keep one. But I'm still hesitating.

Listening music sometimes, movies for relax, no video games. Have a plan to learn piano, but still in hesitation 😅.

A dim boy, with simple habits.

### Work
Have some applications for UWP, like Beansprout, DQD and ENRZ(Continued use can make men frail 🥛XD). Anyway it's all college stuff.

There is no development in the country with M$ 💲, so i give up. I choose to be a front-end engineer after graduation with angular and typescript, maybe with React in the future.

### Currently
Working in my personal MVC framework [Bonbons] baseed on express currently, you may take a look if you want. Not good at Node, so I hope you can give me some advice.
